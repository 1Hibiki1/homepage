        <h3>The why</h3>
        <p>
            I've recently been looking at LLMs, and I think I somewhat "know" their architecture at least at a high level. This kinda feels like how I used to write kernels before I went to uni, I had a lot of fun and thought I understood stuff, but I only really got a decent understanding after taking all those systems classes at uni. I can imagine its the same for AI/ML. I could look at one or two things that I think are important or relevant, but having a broad overview of the field will help a lot. I cant really say that I "understand" stuff in ML, I just know that they exist. If I hav learned one thing in systems, it's that really understanding what u r working with helps IMMENSELY. For ML, I want to understanding how the science, software (libraries etc), and the hardware work in detail. I'll start with the science.

        <h3>The what</h3>
        <p>
            I'm gonna follow CMU courses, cuz most of them have at least their lecture slides available publicly. For now, I plan to do these in sequence:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/~gdicaro/15281/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15-281: AI</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/~gdicaro/10315/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-315: Intro to ML</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S24/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11-785: Intro to DL</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10425/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-625: Convex Optimization</a><span style="font-size: 0.7em;"> (maybe)</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-714: DL sys</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://llmsystem.github.io/llmsystem2024spring/docs/Syllabus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11-868: LLM sys</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://cmu-multicomp-lab.github.io/mmml-course/fall2022/schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11-777: Multimodal ML</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            That being said, I'm not just gonna look at the lecture slides/videos/readings, i'll very likely look outside too. The courses are more like a structured index of topics that are probably helpful to know about. The most important thing would be to implement everything I learn, cuz if I cant implement it then I probably don't understand it. Here's an overview of each class and what they cover (as I understand it):
            <br><br>
            <h4>15-281 AI</h4>
            <p>
                The broad topics as seen on the schedule are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Agents, search spaces & problems</li>
                    <li>Uninformed and Informed search</li>
                    <li>Adversarial Search</li>
                    <li>Classical Planning</li>
                    <li>Constraint Satisfaction Problems</li>
                    <li>Convex Optimization</li>
                    <li>Integer Optimization</li>
                    <li>Bayesian Networks</li>
                    <li>Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models</li>
                    <li>Markov Decision Processes</li>
                    <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
                    <li>Game Theory</li>
                </ul>
                Wow, that's a lot. Well, there's only one to four lectures on each of these, so it's not covered in depth (which makes sense, this is an introductory class).
